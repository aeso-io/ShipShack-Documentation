ShipShack uses a PostgreSQL database. There are multiple ways to install a PostgreSQL database on your local machine, but I recommend using Docker.

To make this process easier, there is a `start-database.sh` script at the root of the project. You can run this script to start a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container.

First, install Docker using the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). 

Open Docker and ensure the Docker engine is running before continuing.

Then, update the following two lines in the `start-database.sh` script:

```bash
DB_CONTAINER_NAME="shipshack-postgres" # The name of your new Docker container
DB_NAME="shipshack" # The name of the database that will be created
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
./start-database.sh
```

This script will create a docke image, start a container, and create a database called `shipshack` with the user `shipshack` and password `shipshack`.

If you are running this script on Windows, use the following instructions:
1. Install [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
2. Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
3. Open WSL: `wsl`
4. Run this script - `./start-database.sh`
</Accordion>

This script will automatically update your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to point to your new local database.

After your database has been created, you can run the following command to push your schema. Note: this is a destructive action, and will delete any existing data in the database.

```bash
bun run db:push
```

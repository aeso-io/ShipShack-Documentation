## Setting up a local PostgreSQL database

If you have note followed the instructions on the [QuickStart](/quickstart) page for deploying a local database, follow these steps:

<Database />

---

## Setting up your database schema

After you have set up your database, you need to create the tables that ShipShack uses. To do this, edit the `schema.ts` file.

For example, if you were making a blog and wanted to have a Posts table, you could add the following code to `schema.ts`:

```typescript
export const posts = createTable(
  "post",
  {
    id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
    name: varchar("name", { length: 256 }),
    createdById: varchar("createdById", { length: 255 })
      .notNull()
      .references(() => users.id),
    createdAt: timestamp("created_at")
      .default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`)
      .notNull(),
    updatedAt: timestamp("updatedAt"),
  },
  (example) => ({
    createdByIdIdx: index("createdById_idx").on(example.createdById),
    nameIndex: index("name_idx").on(example.name),
  }),
);
```

When you make changes to your schema, you need to run the following command to update your database. 


<Warning>Running this command will drop all of your tables and data. It should only be run on your local development machine. For changing your schema in production, use [Drizzle Migrations](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/migrations).</Warning>

```bash
bun run db:push
```


---

## Viewing your table data

ShipShack uses Drizzle, a TypeScript ORM that allows you to interact with your database in a type-safe way. 

Drizzle also comes with Drizzle Studio, a way to explore your database. To start Drizzle Studio, run the following command:

```bash
bun run db:studio
```

Then, in your browser, visit:

```
https://local.drizzle.studio
```

## Setting up a production database

First, follow the instructions on the [Deploy](/deploy) page to deploy your application. The recommended hosting provider is [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

After you have deployed to Vercel, follow [their instructions](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/quickstart) on setting up a Vercel Postgres. When that is complete, your Vercel app will automatically have the following environment variable set:

```
POSTGRES_URL
```

For ShipShack to work, you must add another environment variable:

```
DATABASE_URL
```

And set it equal to the value of POSTGRES_URL.

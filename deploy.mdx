ShipShack can be deployed to the recommended hosting provider, Vercel, in just a few steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Push your changes to a private repository">
  Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) repository to store your code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel in their portal">
  Follow [Vercel's guide](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git#deploying-a-git-repository) to link your repository and deploy a version of your app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup your production database">
  Follow [Vercel's instructions](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/quickstart) on setting up a Postgres database.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add all of your environment variables to Vercel">
  Copy all of your environment variables from your `.env` file to the Vercel dashboard.
  <Tip>Vercel allows you to copy all of your environment variables into the portal at once. Just copy all the variables and values you want and paste them into the "Key" field.</Tip>
  <Warning>Don't forget to set your DATABASE_URL environment variable to the same value as the POSTGRES_URL value.</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Push a commit to initiate a deploy">
  After you have set up your database and environment variables, push a commit to your repository to trigger a deploy. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visit your deployed app">
  Once your app has been deployed, you can visit it at the URL provided by Vercel. Make sure to test that everything is working before sending it to potential customers! 😃

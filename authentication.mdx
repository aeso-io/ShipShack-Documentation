ShipShack uses [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) for authentication. Auth.js is a simple, secure, and easy-to-use authentication library that allows you to authenticate users in your application.

Auth.js supports over 80 providers, including Google, Facebook, GitHub, and more. To add more providers to your application, you can follow the instructions in the [Auth.js documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/oauth).

<Info>By default, ShipShack uses "Magic Links" for the authentication process. Magic Links are a secure way to authenticate users without requiring them to remember a password. When a user signs up or logs in, they receive an email with a link that they can click to authenticate themselves.</Info>

By default, ShipShack places the provider configuration in `/src/app/server/auth.js`.
